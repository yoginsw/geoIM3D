/**
 * Wait until every same-origin build asset the first load pulled in is durably
 * present in Cache Storage, so going offline can't strip a chunk the cold boot
 * needs. Each `/assets/` file is cached either by the revision-keyed precache
 * (durable at SW install) or by the CacheFirst runtime rule (written
 * asynchronously *after* the page's fetch resolves — see vite.config.ts). The
 * runtime write is the race: "canvas visible" can happen while the SW is still
 * persisting a chunk. Polling every loaded asset (not just the >4 MB ones, which
 * misses the smaller globIgnored feature chunks) gives a deterministic
 * "ready to go offline" signal. `ignoreSearch` lets the plain resource URL match
 * a revision-keyed precache entry (`…?__WB_REVISION__=…`) as well as the
 * plain-URL runtime entry.
 *
 * NOTE: this must NOT use `page.waitForFunction` with an async predicate.
 * waitForFunction does not await a promise the predicate returns — a returned
 * promise is truthy, so the poll "passes" on the very first tick without ever
 * checking the caches. (That silent vacuous pass is exactly why this gate let
 * the test go offline before the ~13 MB MapLibre chunk's CacheFirst write had
 * finished, intermittently failing the offline boot.) `page.evaluate` *does*
 * await the async function and return its resolved value, so we drive the poll
 * from Node with `expect.poll`.
