// CDN PGlite loader: used only by the embed (Jupyter wheel) build, which aliases
// `./pglite-loader` to this module when GEOLIBRE_PGLITE_CDN=1 (see vite.config.ts).
// It fetches PGlite and its PostGIS extension from jsDelivr at runtime instead of
// vendoring their ~25 MB of WASM/data/postgis.tar into the wheel. PGlite resolves
// its own .wasm/.data/postgis.tar relative to the loaded module URL, so the pinned
// jsDelivr URL transparently pulls those companion files from the CDN too.
//
// The URLs come from `define` constants injected by vite.config.ts, pinned to the
// installed package versions so they cannot drift from the lockfile. The
// `@vite-ignore` comments keep Vite from trying to resolve/bundle the CDN URLs.
