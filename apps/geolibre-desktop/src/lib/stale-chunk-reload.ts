/**
 * Recovery for stale lazy-loaded chunks after a redeploy.
 *
 * On a static host (the GitHub Pages web demo behind viewer.geolibre.app), each
 * deployment writes content-hashed JS chunks and deletes the previous build's
 * chunks. Browsers cache hashed assets for hours, so a tab that loaded an
 * earlier build keeps a cached lazy chunk whose dynamic `import()` targets a
 * now-deleted chunk. Opening the panel that chunk backs (e.g. Add Raster Layer)
 * then fetches the missing chunk and 404s, surfacing as
 * "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module".
 *
 * Vite dispatches a cancelable `vite:preloadError` event on `window` for exactly
 * this case. Reloading the page re-evaluates the current build's import graph,
 * so the lazy import resolves to a chunk that still exists. A short cooldown
 * guards against a reload loop when the failure is a genuinely broken build
 * rather than a stale chunk.
