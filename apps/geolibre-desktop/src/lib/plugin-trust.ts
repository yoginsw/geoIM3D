// Trust gating for plugin manifest URLs carried inside a project file.
//
// A `.geolibre.json` project is opened as data and can come from anyone (a
// shared file, a URL, a gallery card). It can carry `plugins.manifestUrls`,
// each of which the app would otherwise fetch and dynamically `import()` as a
// JavaScript module in the privileged renderer context (with access to the
// Tauri APIs on desktop). Executing that code on open, with no user decision,
// lets a shared project silently extend the app's trusted codebase (#1062).
//
// So project-supplied URLs never auto-load. Only URLs the user has already
// explicitly installed (their desktop settings) or that ship baked into the
// build (bundled drop-ins) are trusted to load automatically; every other
// project URL is held back until the user approves it in a trust prompt.

import { isAllowedPluginManifestUrl } from "@geolibre/core";
import { normalizeStringList } from "./string-lists";

  /** Project URLs already trusted (installed in settings or bundled). */

/**
 * Split the plugin manifest URLs carried by a project into the already-trusted
 * subset and the untrusted subset.
 *
 * A URL is trusted only when the user has previously installed it (it is in
 * `trustedManifestUrls`, i.e. the desktop settings list) or it ships with the
 * build (`bundledManifestUrls`). Everything else is untrusted and must not be
 * fetched or imported until the user makes an explicit trust decision.
 *
 * URLs that fail the scheme allow-list (`isAllowedPluginManifestUrl`) can never
 * load, so they are dropped from both lists — matching the filter applied when
 * the project file is parsed (`normalizeProjectPlugins`).
 *
 * @param projectManifestUrls - `plugins.manifestUrls` from the opened project.
 * @param trustedManifestUrls - The user's installed plugin URLs (desktop settings).
 * @param bundledManifestUrls - URLs for plugins baked into the build.
 * @returns The trusted and untrusted partitions, de-duplicated and trimmed.
