// never embedded into the Tauri binary (it was ~8.6 MB brotli — the entire
// 27 → 36 MB v1.3 installer growth).
//
// Only the wasm URL differs from the bundled loader: the JS engine is still
// dynamically imported the same way (it is small and lives in its own lazy
// chunk), but its WebAssembly module is fetched from jsDelivr at runtime via the
// `wasmUrl` option instead of from a vendored `?url` asset. The URL is injected
// by vite.config.ts, pinned to the installed package version.
