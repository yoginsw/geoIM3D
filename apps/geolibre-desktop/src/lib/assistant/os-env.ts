 * environment via the `read_env_vars` Tauri command so API keys can be sourced
 * from environment variables instead of the saved project file (issue #1141).
 *
 * The webview itself cannot read `process.env`; only the Rust backend can, so
 * this is desktop-only. In the browser/Jupyter builds it resolves to `{}`. The
 * set of names read is the curated {@link OS_ENV_VAR_NAMES} allowlist (also
 * enforced Rust-side), which excludes ambient credentials like `AWS_*`.
 *
 * The result is cached in this module so callers can read it synchronously
 * without exposing credentials through a public window map.

 * no-op that caches an empty map.
 *
 * The result of a *successful* read is memoized: concurrent startup callers
 * share the one in-flight request, and later calls return the cached snapshot
 * without re-invoking the backend. A failed read is swallowed (a missing
 * capability must never block startup), logged for diagnosis, and — crucially —
 * does **not** poison the memo: `loadPromise` is reset so a later call retries
 * rather than the whole feature silently no-op-ing for the session after one
 * transient IPC hiccup. A failure also never clobbers an already-cached snapshot.
