 * A Time Slider COG source is a single template URL (e.g.
 * `https://.../{date:YYYY}.tif`) that resolves to a different Cloud Optimized
 * GeoTIFF per timeline date. Stepping the timeline therefore walks a temporal
 * stack of COGs. This module clicks a single pixel through that stack: for every
 * timeline step it resolves the source URL, HTTP-range-reads just the tile under
 * the click, and records *every* band value, producing a value-over-time series
 * the UI charts (for a user-chosen band) and can export.
 *
 * It reuses `maplibre-gl-raster`'s `loadGeoTIFF`/`readPixelValues`, the same
 * client-side reader the single-COG Identify tool uses, so no Python sidecar or
 * full-file download is involved.
