 * renders interleaved deck layers: the deckgl-viz overlay (Deck.gl layers plus
 * 3D Z-value vectors), Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles, and the web COG raster
 * control.
 *
 * deck.gl keeps exactly ONE interleaved Deck per map, stored on `map.__deck`
 * (see `@deck.gl/mapbox`'s getDeckInstance). A second interleaved MapboxOverlay
 * reuses that same Deck, but each overlay's `setProps({ layers })` overwrites
 * the Deck's entire layer list with only its own layers -- so the last overlay
 * to render wins and the others' layers silently vanish, and removing one
 * interleaved overlay finalizes the shared Deck out from under the others (see
 * opengeos/GeoLibre#1149: enabling a track's "3D (Z values)" made Google
 * Photorealistic tiles disappear). Routing every interleaved producer through
 * this one overlay keeps their layers in a single `setProps` call, so they
 * coexist. Overlaid (non-interleaved) overlays -- ArcGIS I3S, the Tauri raster
 * fallback -- own a separate deck canvas and are unaffected, so they keep their
 * own overlays.
