- [x] Download Offline Area tool that pre-caches the current map view's basemap tiles into the service-worker cache
- [x] Service-worker caching of the CDN-loaded Pyodide and PGlite/PostGIS engines so browser SQL and Python keep working offline after first use

## v1.4: Jupyter beside the map, spectral indices, georeferencing, and field collection

- [x] Resizable, collapsible Notebook panel docked beside the map: the web build embeds a self-hosted JupyterLite site (in-browser Pyodide kernel) and the desktop build launches a uv-managed JupyterLab server, both seeded with a runnable Welcome tour. Notebook cells drive the live map through the shared scripting bridge via an auto-loaded `geolibre` client, and the JupyterLite theme follows the app theme — see [Notebook Panel](notebook.md)
- [x] Spectral Index toolbox under Processing → Raster (NDVI, GNDVI, NDWI, NDMI, NDBI, NBR, EVI, and SAVI) with Sentinel-2, Landsat 8-9, NAIP, and custom band layouts and a reflectance-scale knob, evaluated client-side via geotiff.js or on the rasterio sidecar through the existing raster calculator
- [x] Raster Georeferencer (Processing → Georeferencing): pin a non-georeferenced image to the map with ground control points, using a least-squares affine fit and per-GCP and RMS residuals, added as a corner-pinned overlay that persists in the project and works offline
- [x] Field Collection tool (Controls menu) for capturing point, line, and polygon observations with a per-layer custom form (text/number/date/choice fields and an optional inline photo), placed by device GPS or by tapping the map, with a floating quick-open control; captures are written to a tagged GeoJSON layer that flows into the attribute table, export, and offline use
- [x] Runtime overrides for `VITE_PYODIDE_INDEX_URL` and `VITE_DUCKDB_SPATIAL_EXTENSION_PATH` through the existing runtime-environment system, so air-gapped or corporate deployments can point Pyodide and the DuckDB Spatial extension at internal mirrors without rebuilding the app

## v1.5: Dashboards, in-browser Whitebox, map navigation history, and signed macOS installers

- [x] Dashboard panel of chart widgets that summarizes the loaded layers at a glance, with configurable charts and a collapsible layout that docks alongside the map
- [x] Whitebox toolbox now runs entirely in the browser through a WebAssembly runtime with raster I/O, so its tools (and GeoLibre's own WASM raster tools, now surfaced in the same toolbox) work with no Python sidecar
- [x] Print layout composer gained an explicit map-scale input, a title block with editable title and footer, page-size controls, and a custom print extent, with more reliable preview rendering for production-quality PNG and PDF map exports
- [x] Time Slider can bind existing vector layers already on the map to the timeline, animating their time-series attributes without re-importing the data
- [x] New View menu with viewport history navigation (step back and forward through previous map extents), a reset pitch and bearing control with a rotation indicator, a distinct north arrow in place of the ambiguous compass, a lock indicator when map bounds are restricted, and a refined default set of top-right map controls
- [x] Saved service library for web-service layers, so frequently used WMS, WFS, XYZ, and ArcGIS endpoints can be stored once and re-added with a click rather than re-entered each session
- [x] Add Data dialog is now fully internationalized and accepts comma decimal separators and drag-and-dropped CSV files for coordinate data
- [x] Inspect COG pixel values directly from the Identify icon, plus reversed and custom raster color ramps, the full colormap list, and a styling panel you can reopen from the layer actions menu
- [x] Customizable UI profiles that tailor which menus, panels, and data sources are visible, so a deployment can present a focused subset of the app to its users (see [UI Profiles](ui-profiles.md))
- [x] Bookmarks now capture the active layers alongside the camera, with selectable export, a resizable and reorderable panel, and a save-as name prompt
- [x] Sequential route (directions) network tool under Processing for computing routes through an ordered set of waypoints
- [x] Protomaps basemaps in the New map dialog, support for stacking multiple raster basemaps, and basemap element visibility presets in the layer control
- [x] Spinning Globe panel under Atmospheric Effects and customizable atmosphere halo and deep-space colors for the globe view
- [x] Notebook panel can split the workspace 50/50 with the map and auto-collapse the Style panel for more room, and the attribute table gains a column explorer for finding and toggling fields in wide tables
- [x] USGS LiDAR plugin replaces the previous LiDAR Viewer for browsing and loading USGS 3DEP point-cloud data, imported KML and KMZ layers honor their embedded symbology, and vector strokes can be sized in scale-proportional meters
- [x] macOS desktop installers are now signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple, so they open without a Gatekeeper workaround, with a generator for submitting GeoLibre to the official Homebrew cask (see [Downloads](downloads.md))

## v1.6: Multi-map layouts, advanced symbology and labeling, and plugin zip install

- [x] Multi-map grid that splits the workspace into a grid of map views with synchronized camera movement, so you can compare basemaps, layers, or time steps side by side
- [x] Advanced vector symbology with a rule-based renderer (filter-driven style rules), proportional symbols, fill patterns, and a built-in marker library for richer point and polygon styling
- [x] Label engine that labels vector features by any attribute, with placement and styling controls
- [x] Install external plugins from an uploaded zip on both desktop and web, alongside the existing manifest-URL and bundled drop-in paths, with the Manage Plugins list now sorted alphabetically

- [x] Guided update workflow with a startup update check, update preferences, and clearer status colors
- [x] Time Slider defaults an unspecified end date to the current date
- [x] Windows Package Manager (winget) packaging as `OpenGeos.GeoLibre`, so the app can be installed and updated through winget
- [x] [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nwt67rv531x) listing, so Windows users can install the signed, auto-updating build directly from the Store (see [Downloads](downloads.md))

## v1.7: Plugin UI host API, color ramp previews, and category-browsed Whitebox tools

- [x] Plugin UI host API that lets plugins register first-class right-sidebar panels, toolbar menus, and floating panels that dock beside the built-in Style panel instead of emulating an overlay, with external plugin toolbar menus now placed after the Help menu (see [Plugin API](plugin-api.md))
- [x] Color ramp gradient swatches in both the vector Style panel and the raster Color ramp picker, so you can see each colormap's gradient inline (on the trigger and beside every option) while choosing rather than picking from a plain list of names
- [x] Richer vector labeling with ArcGIS-style controls (anchor, X/Y offset, rotation, wrap width, and letter case), a Duplicate labels option, and unique/concatenate modes that collapse points stacked at the same coordinate into a single deduplicated label
- [x] Whitebox toolbox is now browsable by category directly in the Processing menu, with nested subcategory submenus, GeoLibre's own WASM tools grouped under their own subheading, an offline-bundled tool catalog for restricted environments, and tools that open the dialog preselected and scrolled into view
- [x] On-canvas collaboration session-status badge and roster (a pulsing live dot, connected-participant count, and an expandable client list that announces joins and leaves), plus a clear "Go to map and collaborate" button so the host has a non-destructive way back to the map
- [x] Welcome wizard is suppressed for embeds: project deep links (`?url=`) skip onboarding automatically, and a new `?welcome=0` parameter lets any embed opt out

## v1.8: Camera tours, live story maps, standalone HTML export, and map annotations

- [x] Record an animated camera tour to video straight from the Controls menu, with a clearer keyframe layout, per-keyframe recapture, a two-step save, and the ability to save and reload the entire tour setup as a JSON file
- [x] Story Map plugin can now compose its chapters directly on the live map instead of a separate editor, and generates a printable PDF handout of the finished story

- [x] Windows portable zip build, so the desktop app can run without installation

## v1.9: CAD import, smarter service discovery, and a docked SQL workspace (current)

- [x] Add CAD drawings (DXF/DWG) as a layer, with a layer picker for choosing which drawing layers to load and a CRS selector for placing the geometry correctly on the map
- [x] WMS and WFS panels now read the service's GetCapabilities document to list the available layers and feature types, so you pick from a populated dropdown instead of typing layer names by hand
- [x] Generic Vector to Vector conversion tool that converts between any supported vector formats by file extension, alongside the existing targeted converters
- [x] SQL Workspace docks as a resizable panel beside the map (rather than a floating window) and gains editor autocomplete for tables, columns, and SQL keywords

- [x] Website and GitHub links added to the Help menu for quick access to the project home and source

## Plugin marketplace and registry (design)

This captures the design for the `v1.0` "Plugin marketplace / registry" item. It
builds on the existing external-plugin foundation, the `plugin.json` manifest
contract, HTTPS manifest-URL loading, the desktop app data `plugins/` scan, and
the bundled `public/plugins/` drop-in mechanism, and it relates to the "External
plugin package distribution workflow" item.

### Goal

Let users discover, install, update, and remove trusted external plugins from a
curated registry without hand-entering manifest URLs, on both the desktop and
web builds, while keeping the existing trust model in which plugins are trusted
code.

### Registry

- A curated, versioned index published as static JSON (for example
  `registry.json` hosted on `geolibre.app`, or generated from a GitHub
  repository of submissions). No live backend is required for the MVP.
- Each entry carries `id`, `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`,
  `homepage`, `manifestUrl`, `categories`, `minGeoLibreVersion`, and optional
  `screenshots`.
- The index is fetched over HTTPS and cached; entries point at the same
  `plugin.json` manifests the existing loader already understands.

### Browse and install UI

- A standalone Manage Plugins dialog (Settings menu > Manage Plugins), modeled
  on QGIS, has All / Installed / Not installed / Upgradeable / Settings sections.
  The four browse sections list registry entries with search and per-entry
  install, installed, and update states; the Settings section manages plugin
  sources.
- Install reuses the current external-plugin loader: it resolves the entry's
  `manifestUrl`, validates it, and registers the plugin.
  - Desktop: download the bundle into the app data `plugins/<id>/` directory so
    it persists and loads on startup through the existing scan.
  - Web: record the entry's `manifestUrl` in desktop settings (and, for shared
    projects, in the project `plugins.manifestUrls`) so it loads on next open.
- Remove drops the recorded manifest URL and unregisters the plugin at runtime
  (tearing down any active control), so the change takes effect without a
  restart. (The MVP records manifest URLs rather than downloading bundles; the
  desktop bundle-download path above is a later enhancement.)

### Updates and versioning

- Compare the installed `version` against the registry entry, surface an update
  available state, and offer a one-click update that re-fetches the bundle.
- Honor `minGeoLibreVersion` so incompatible plugins are flagged, not installed.

### Trust and security

- The registry is an allowlist; only curated entries are offered for install.
- HTTPS-only manifests (the existing `isAllowedPluginManifestUrl` rule).
- Explicit user consent on install, because plugin entries execute as trusted
  code (the desktop CSP permits `blob:` script execution by design).
- The curated registry and explicit install consent are the primary controls.

### Relationship to bundled plugins

- Bundled `public/plugins/<id>/` drop-ins remain the zero-config way to ship
  first-party or private plugins inside a build. The marketplace covers
  discoverable, user-installed third-party plugins; the two are complementary
  and share the same `plugin.json` contract and loader.

### Phasing

1. Curated static registry plus browse and install through manifest URLs
   (reuses the current loader; records the manifest URL in settings). **Done.**
2. Version checks, update and removal flows.
3. Submission workflow for third-party authors.

### Implementation (phase 1)

The MVP ships in the desktop app and, because the same frontend serves the web
build, works in both:

- `apps/geolibre-desktop/src/lib/plugin-registry.ts` fetches and normalizes a
  registry (`{ "plugins": [...] }`), resolving each entry's `manifestUrl`
  against the registry location. The registry URL is
  `VITE_GEOLIBRE_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_URL` or, by default, the hosted registry at
  `https://plugins.geolibre.app/plugin-registry.json`.
- `apps/geolibre-desktop/src/components/layout/ManagePluginsDialog.tsx` is a
  standalone dialog (Settings menu > Manage Plugins) with All / Installed / Not
  installed / Upgradeable / Settings sections: search, install, a confirm step
  before uninstall, an Update action when a newer version is published,
  `minGeoLibreVersion` compatibility checks, and inline error handling. The
  Settings section manages additional local directories and manual manifest
  URLs. All actions apply immediately (live).
- Installing records the entry's manifest URL in the plugin manifest URL list,
  so the existing external-plugin loader fetches and registers it. No new trust
  path is introduced. Uninstalling (after confirmation) unregisters the plugin
  at runtime — tearing down any active map control — so the Plugins menu updates
  without a reload. Update re-fetches the manifest URL and re-registers the
  published version in place, fetching the new version before tearing down the
  old one so a failed update leaves the installed plugin intact.
- The registry and plugin bundles live in the
  [opengeos/geolibre-plugins](https://github.com/opengeos/geolibre-plugins) repo,
  published to GitHub Pages at `plugins.geolibre.app`; it ships a `sample/`
  template and maintainers add curated entries there.
