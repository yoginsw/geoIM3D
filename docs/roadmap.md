## Plugin marketplace and registry (design)

This captures the design for the `v1.0` "Plugin marketplace / registry" item. It
builds on the existing external-plugin foundation, the `plugin.json` manifest
contract, HTTPS manifest-URL loading, the desktop app data `plugins/` scan, and
the bundled `public/plugins/` drop-in mechanism, and it relates to the "External
plugin package distribution workflow" item.

### Goal

Let users discover, install, update, and remove trusted external plugins from a
curated registry without hand-entering manifest URLs, on both the desktop and
web builds, while keeping the existing trust model in which plugins are trusted
code.

### Registry

- A curated, versioned index published as static JSON (for example
  `registry.json` hosted on `geolibre.app`, or generated from a GitHub
  repository of submissions). No live backend is required for the MVP.
- Each entry carries `id`, `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`,
  `homepage`, `manifestUrl`, `categories`, `minGeoLibreVersion`, and optional
  `screenshots`.
- The index is fetched over HTTPS and cached; entries point at the same
  `plugin.json` manifests the existing loader already understands.

### Browse and install UI

- A standalone Manage Plugins dialog (Settings menu > Manage Plugins), modeled
  on QGIS, has All / Installed / Not installed / Upgradeable / Settings sections.
  The four browse sections list registry entries with search and per-entry
  install, installed, and update states; the Settings section manages plugin
  sources.
- Install reuses the current external-plugin loader: it resolves the entry's
  `manifestUrl`, validates it, and registers the plugin.
  - Desktop: download the bundle into the app data `plugins/<id>/` directory so
    it persists and loads on startup through the existing scan.
  - Web: record the entry's `manifestUrl` in desktop settings (and, for shared
    projects, in the project `plugins.manifestUrls`) so it loads on next open.
- Remove drops the recorded manifest URL and unregisters the plugin at runtime
  (tearing down any active control), so the change takes effect without a
  restart. (The MVP records manifest URLs rather than downloading bundles; the
  desktop bundle-download path above is a later enhancement.)

### Updates and versioning

- Compare the installed `version` against the registry entry, surface an update
  available state, and offer a one-click update that re-fetches the bundle.
- Honor `minGeoLibreVersion` so incompatible plugins are flagged, not installed.

### Trust and security

- The registry is an allowlist; only curated entries are offered for install.
- HTTPS-only manifests (the existing `isAllowedPluginManifestUrl` rule).
- Explicit user consent on install, because plugin entries execute as trusted
  code (the desktop CSP permits `blob:` script execution by design).
- The curated registry and explicit install consent are the primary controls.

### Relationship to bundled plugins

- Bundled `public/plugins/<id>/` drop-ins remain the zero-config way to ship
  first-party or private plugins inside a build. The marketplace covers
  discoverable, user-installed third-party plugins; the two are complementary
  and share the same `plugin.json` contract and loader.

### Phasing

1. Curated static registry plus browse and install through manifest URLs
   (reuses the current loader; records the manifest URL in settings). **Done.**
2. Version checks, update and removal flows.
3. Submission workflow for third-party authors.

### Implementation (phase 1)

The MVP ships in the desktop app and, because the same frontend serves the web
build, works in both:

- `apps/geolibre-desktop/src/lib/plugin-registry.ts` fetches and normalizes a
  registry (`{ "plugins": [...] }`), resolving each entry's `manifestUrl`
  against the registry location. The registry URL is
  `VITE_GEOLIBRE_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_URL` or, by default, the hosted registry at
  `https://plugins.geolibre.app/plugin-registry.json`.
- `apps/geolibre-desktop/src/components/layout/ManagePluginsDialog.tsx` is a
  standalone dialog (Settings menu > Manage Plugins) with All / Installed / Not
  installed / Upgradeable / Settings sections: search, install, a confirm step
  before uninstall, an Update action when a newer version is published,
  `minGeoLibreVersion` compatibility checks, and inline error handling. The
  Settings section manages additional local directories and manual manifest
  URLs. All actions apply immediately (live).
- Installing records the entry's manifest URL in the plugin manifest URL list,
  so the existing external-plugin loader fetches and registers it. No new trust
  path is introduced. Uninstalling (after confirmation) unregisters the plugin
  at runtime — tearing down any active map control — so the Plugins menu updates
  without a reload. Update re-fetches the manifest URL and re-registers the
  published version in place, fetching the new version before tearing down the
  old one so a failed update leaves the installed plugin intact.
- The registry and plugin bundles live in the
  [opengeos/geolibre-plugins](https://github.com/opengeos/geolibre-plugins) repo,
  published to GitHub Pages at `plugins.geolibre.app`; it ships a `sample/`
  template and maintainers add curated entries there.
