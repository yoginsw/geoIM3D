# SQL Workspace

The **SQL Workspace** runs DuckDB Spatial SQL right in the app, against your loaded layers, local files, and remote URLs. Open it from **Processing → SQL Workspace**. The spatial extension is loaded for you, so `ST_*` functions are available.

## Querying loaded layers

Every loaded vector layer is exposed as a queryable table; the dialog lists the available table names at the top. Write a query in the editor and click **Run** to see the results.

```sql
SELECT NAME, CONTINENT, POP_EST
FROM countries
ORDER BY POP_EST DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Reading files and URLs

You can query files and remote URLs directly. The workspace auto-wraps a bare URL into the matching reader (for example Parquet, CSV, JSON, or GeoJSON) and streams remote files over HTTP range requests, so you do not have to download them first.

```sql
SELECT NAME, CONTINENT, POP_EST, geom
FROM https://data.source.coop/giswqs/opengeos/countries.parquet
LIMIT 100;
```

## Cloud URLs (s3://, gs://, az://)

Cloud object-store URLs are transparently rewritten to their public HTTPS equivalents, so you can use them directly in queries:

```sql
-- Amazon S3
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('s3://bucket/path/to/data.parquet') LIMIT 10;

-- Google Cloud Storage
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('gs://bucket/path/to/data.parquet') LIMIT 10;

-- Azure Blob Storage
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('az://account/container/data.parquet') LIMIT 10;
```

The bare `FROM s3://…` form works too — the workspace wraps it in the matching reader automatically.

!!! note "Public access only"
    Cloud URL translation targets anonymous / public buckets. Private buckets that require credentials are not yet supported.

!!! tip "CORS"
    Browser-side reads require the bucket's CORS policy to allow cross-origin requests. Most public dataset buckets (e.g. AWS Open Data, Source Cooperative) already allow this. If you hit a CORS error, check the bucket's CORS configuration.

## Sample queries and history

- **Sample queries** and **Sample query for layer** menus drop ready-made queries into the editor to get you started.
- Your previous queries are kept in a **history** so you can rerun them.

## Using the results

When a query returns geometry, you can **add the result to the map** as a new layer (with an optional layer name). The result layer behaves like any vector layer, with [identify, selection, and the attribute table](attribute-table.md). You can also **export** results as CSV or GeoParquet.

!!! tip "Multiple result layers"
    You can add several DuckDB query-result layers to the same project and keep them all open at once.

See the [Spatial SQL tutorial](../tutorials/spatial-sql.md) for an end-to-end walkthrough. The SQL Workspace works in both the browser and the desktop app because it runs on DuckDB-WASM.
