# SQL Workspace

The **SQL Workspace** runs DuckDB Spatial SQL right in the app, against your loaded layers, local files, and remote URLs. Open it from **Processing → SQL Workspace**. The spatial extension is loaded for you, so `ST_*` functions are available.


## Querying loaded layers

Every loaded vector layer is exposed as a queryable table; the dialog lists the available table names at the top. Write a query in the editor and click **Run** to see the results.

```sql
SELECT NAME, CONTINENT, POP_EST
FROM countries
ORDER BY POP_EST DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Reading files and URLs

You can query files and remote URLs directly. The workspace auto-wraps a bare URL into the matching reader (for example Parquet, CSV, JSON, or GeoJSON) and streams remote files over HTTP range requests, so you do not have to download them first.

```sql
SELECT NAME, CONTINENT, POP_EST, geom
FROM https://data.source.coop/giswqs/opengeos/countries.parquet
LIMIT 100;
```

## Cloud URLs (s3://, gs://, az://)

Cloud object-store URLs are transparently rewritten to their public HTTPS equivalents, so you can use them directly in queries:

```sql
-- Amazon S3
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('s3://bucket/path/to/data.parquet') LIMIT 10;

-- Google Cloud Storage
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('gs://bucket/path/to/data.parquet') LIMIT 10;

-- Azure Blob Storage
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('az://account/container/data.parquet') LIMIT 10;
```

The bare `FROM s3://…` form works too — the workspace wraps it in the matching reader automatically.

!!! note "Public access only"
    Cloud URL translation targets anonymous / public buckets. Private buckets that require credentials are not yet supported.

!!! tip "CORS"
    Browser-side reads require the bucket's CORS policy to allow cross-origin requests. Most public dataset buckets (e.g. AWS Open Data, Source Cooperative) already allow this. If you hit a CORS error, check the bucket's CORS configuration.

## Choosing a SQL engine

The **Engine** menu (top right) selects which SQL engine runs your query. All three load a spatial extension, so `ST_*` functions are available in each.

- **DuckDB** (default) — DuckDB Spatial, in-browser. Queries loaded layers, local files, and remote URLs (including `s3://`/`gs://`/`az://` public data). Works offline after first use.
- **PostGIS** — PGlite + PostGIS, in-browser. Queries loaded layers using full PostGIS SQL. The first run loads a ~19 MB engine.
- **Apache Sedona** — Sedona spatial SQL over your loaded layers. It runs in-browser on [CereusDB](https://github.com/tobilg/cereusdb), a WebAssembly build of Apache [SedonaDB](https://sedona.apache.org/sedonadb/). On the desktop app it uses the **SedonaDB sidecar** instead when the optional `sedona` extra is installed (better for larger layers); otherwise it falls back to the in-browser engine automatically. The CereusDB engine is downloaded lazily on first use.

!!! note "Sedona reads loaded layers"
    Like PostGIS, the Apache Sedona engine queries layers you have loaded into the map (listed as **Queryable layers**). The geometry column is named `geometry`, so spatial functions look like `ST_Centroid(geometry)`, `ST_Area(geometry)`, or `ST_Buffer(geometry, 0.1)`.

!!! note "Attribute columns in the browser engine"
    With the in-browser CereusDB engine, `SELECT *` returns each layer's attributes as columns (and "Add as layer" preserves them), but you cannot yet reference an attribute by name in SQL (e.g. `WHERE name = 'Texas'`) — that build exposes attributes only through the `geometry` column and spatial functions. Run the **SedonaDB sidecar** (install the `sedona` extra) for full attribute SQL.

## Sample queries and history

- **Sample queries** and **Sample query for layer** menus drop ready-made queries into the editor to get you started.
- Your previous queries are kept in a **history** so you can rerun them.

## Using the results

When a query returns geometry, you can **add the result to the map** as a new layer (with an optional layer name). The result layer behaves like any vector layer, with [identify, selection, and the attribute table](attribute-table.md). You can also **export** results as CSV or GeoParquet.

!!! tip "Multiple result layers"
    You can add several DuckDB query-result layers to the same project and keep them all open at once.

See the [Spatial SQL tutorial](../tutorials/spatial-sql.md) for an end-to-end walkthrough. The SQL Workspace works in both the browser and the desktop app because it runs on DuckDB-WASM.
