# Story Maps

Story maps turn a project into a scroll-driven narrative. As the reader scrolls,
the map flies between chapters, and project layers can fade in and out. The
feature is inspired by the
[maplibre-gl-storymaps](https://github.com/opengeos/maplibre-gl-storymaps)
template. Authoring and the in-app presentation run locally, though basemap
styles and any chapter images are still fetched from their URLs, and the
standalone HTML export loads MapLibre and scrollama from a CDN.

## Open the builder

Choose **Project → Story Map** to open the builder. The builder edits a story
that is saved inside the `.geoim3d.json` project file, so it travels with your
project.

!!! tip "Try it instantly"
    When the story is empty, click **Load sample story** to populate a five-city
    world tour. Hit **Present** and scroll to see it in action, then edit or
    replace the chapters with your own.

## Story settings

- **Title / Subtitle / Byline / Footer** appear in the presentation header and
  footer. The footer accepts inline HTML (for example, links and credits).
- **Panel theme** switches the chapter panels between light and dark.
- **Show markers** drops a marker at each chapter's center; pick its color.
- **Inset minimap** shows a small overview map in a chosen corner.

## Chapters

Click **Add chapter** to capture the current map view as a new chapter. Each
chapter has:

- **Title**, **Description** (inline HTML allowed), and an optional **Image URL**.
- **Panel alignment**: `left`, `center`, `right`, or `full`.
- **Map animation**: `flyTo`, `easeTo`, or `jumpTo`.
- **Hide panel** keeps the map transition but hides the text (useful for a pure
  map beat).
- **Rotate camera** slowly spins the view after the transition settles.

Use **Set to current view** to re-capture the camera after panning, zooming, or
tilting the map, and the map-pin button to fly to a chapter while editing.
Reorder chapters with the arrows and remove them with the trash icon.

## Import and export chapters

To author content outside GeoLibre, use **Import** / **Export** next to **Add
chapter**:

- **Export JSON** writes the whole story (settings and chapters); **Import JSON**
  reads it back (a full `.geoim3d.json` project file also works).
- **Export CSV** writes one row per chapter (spreadsheet-friendly). **Import CSV**
  replaces the chapters while keeping your current story settings.

The CSV columns are `id, title, description, image, alignment, hidden, lng, lat,
zoom, pitch, bearing, mapAnimation, rotateAnimation, onChapterEnter,
onChapterExit`. Columns are matched by name, so order is flexible and you only
need the ones you use; `lng`/`lat` set the chapter center, and missing ids are
generated on import. The `onChapterEnter`/`onChapterExit` columns hold JSON and
can be left blank when authoring by hand.

### Layer effects

Under **On enter** and **On exit**, add layer fades that run as a chapter
becomes active or is left behind. Pick a project layer and a target opacity (and
optional transition duration). This is how you reveal or hide data as the story
progresses.

## Present

Click **Present** to start the scroll-driven presentation over the live map.
Scroll to move between chapters; press **Esc** or **Exit** to return to editing.

A **navigation pane** on the left lists every chapter for a quick overview;
click any entry to jump straight to it. Toggle the pane with the list button next
to **Exit**. The map controls (navigation, fullscreen, globe, layer control)
stay usable during the presentation.

Each chapter card is **movable and resizable**: drag its title bar to reposition
it (double-click the bar to reset), or drag the bottom-right corner to resize, so
you can move a card aside and explore the map beneath it.

## Export to HTML

Click **Export HTML** to save a self-contained `.html` page that reproduces the
story without GeoLibre. In-memory GeoJSON layers referenced by chapter effects
are inlined so the exported story behaves like the in-app preview. The page is a
single static file you can host anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, or any web
server).
