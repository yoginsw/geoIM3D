# Settings & Preferences

The **Settings** menu holds the workspace preferences: how the map behaves, which panels are visible, runtime environment variables, project settings, and the entry point to [Manage Plugins](plugins.md).

## Map Preferences

**Settings → Map Preferences** controls how the map can be navigated:

![Settings dialog showing Map Preferences](https://data.geolibre.app/images/geolibre-settings.webp)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Restrict map bounds** | Limit panning to a bounding box. |
| **Bounds** | The west, south, east, and north limits of that box. |
| **Min zoom / Max zoom** | The allowed zoom range (0 to 24). |
| **Max pitch** | The maximum tilt angle (0 to 85 degrees). |
| **Render world copies** | Show repeated copies of the world when zoomed out. |

Use **Use Current View** to set the bounds from where the map is now, or **Reset** to restore the defaults. These preferences are saved in the project file.

## Layout

**Settings → Layout** toggles the chrome around the map:

- **Show toolbar labels**: text labels next to toolbar buttons, or icon-only.
- **Show project info**: the project name and path in the toolbar.
- **Show Layers panel**, **Show Style panel**, **Show Attribute panel**: per-panel visibility.

Panels also auto-hide on small screens for a responsive layout.

## Environment Variables

**Settings → Environment Variables** (the **Environment** tab in the Settings dialog) holds the share token and the runtime key-value pairs that GeoLibre and its plugins read, such as API keys:

- **Share.GeoLibre API token**: the personal API token used by **Project → Share** to upload to `share.geolibre.app`. See [Projects](projects.md#share).
- **Environment variables**: named key-value pairs (for example, API keys for Earth Engine, Street View, and other integrations). You can enable or disable individual variables, and secret values are masked. Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

!!! tip "Where credentials go"
    Provider credentials for integrations like Earth Engine, Street View, or other keyed services belong here. See [Data Integrations](data-integrations.md) and [Getting Started](../getting-started.md#optional-imagery-credentials).

!!! tip "Protomaps basemaps"
    To use the [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com) basemaps in the **New map** dialog, add an environment variable named `VITE_PROTOMAPS_API_KEY` with your own Protomaps API key. The Protomaps options appear in the dialog as soon as the key is enabled — no restart needed. When no key is set, the Protomaps section is hidden. See [Getting Started](../getting-started.md#optional-basemap-credentials) for setting the key at build time for a self-hosted deployment.

## Project Settings

**Settings → Project Settings** (the **Project** tab) holds project-level options saved with the `.geolibre.json` file:

- **Project name**: the name shown in the toolbar and saved in the project file.
- **Project file**: the read-only path the project was opened from or last saved to.
- **Project format**: the read-only project format version.

## Manage Plugins

**Settings → Manage Plugins** opens the plugin marketplace. See [Plugins & Marketplace](plugins.md).
